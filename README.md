# 🗂️ File Explorer App

This React-based File Explorer simulates a core part of a developer interface — a File/Folder Tree — similar to what you find in IDEs like VS Code.

It includes interactive features like expanding/collapsing folders, drag-and-drop support, renaming, adding, and deleting nodes. The app persists state across page refreshes using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Tree View Rendering from JSON
- 📂 Expand/Collapse folders
- ✂️ Drag and Drop (files & folders)
- 📝 Rename, Add, Delete nodes
- 💾 Persistent state via `localStorage` or JSON export/import
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind CSS
- 🧠 Uses modern React features

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React (Vite + Functional Components)**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React DnD** or **Dnd Kit** for drag-and-drop
- **Optional**: Zustand or Context API for state management
- **Icon Libraries** like `react-icons` or `lucide-react`
